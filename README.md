# Management_Intelligence
A prototype for an analytical tool to aid management decision-making. It contains four mathematical models; Linear Programming, Assignment model, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Critical path analysis. It also provides two interactive schematic models for project planning and control; Gantt Chart and Network Diagram.

## Issues:
A lot of the features in the code base are hardcoded to show the functionality of the application.

## Status
At 30/7/2021 I have started working on a new iteration of this app. 

## disclaimer:
* This app accompaned an academic paper submitted by Dolu Solana for completion of his undergraduate degree.
* The app is designed to showcase the possibilities of Quantitative analysis to Management decision making.
