# Management_Intelligence
A prototype for an analytical tool to aid management decision-making. It contains four mathematical models; Linear Programming, Assignment model, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Critical path analysis. It also provides two interactive schematic models for project planning and control; Gantt Chart and Network Diagram.

## Issues:
1. A lot of the features in the code base are hardcoded to show the functionality of the application.

2. The package for network analysis and gantt charts is no longer supported by cran. That's why this can't be deployed at the moment.

## Status
At 30/7/2021 I have started working on a new iteration of this app. 

## disclaimer:
* This app accompanied an academic paper submitted by Dolu Solana for completion of his undergraduate degree.
* The app is designed to showcase the possibilities of Quantitative analysis to Management decision making.
